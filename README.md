# github-cli-app
A simple CLI app that logs Github notifications to the Node console.

## Purpose for this Repo
A simple intro to the Github REST API.  Wanted to play with the API and be able to check notifications from the terminal.

### Get started
`git clone`  
`yarn` or `npm i`  
Through the Github User Settings create a Personal Access Token and add it to `index.js` where it says `<YOUR TOKEN>`.  
`node index`  
  
The Octocat will either show you your Github notifications or let you know there are none.
